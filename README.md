The Sac State CKI Discord bot is a bot for Circle K International focused discord servers. With discord being used more by clubs there has become a need for CKI specific commands that other bots do not satisfy so this will be the place to provide those features. There was a previous version that was using Python but that version was more of a proof of concept. Now that I know more of what goes into a great bot, I have created a new version written in JS that hopefully works better and is easier to implement/update.

I will do my best to get features made quickly but I do have work along with my social life so please be patient with me. I hope you find the bot useful and please recommend any features that would help out! Also if there any bugs or errors let me know and I will investigate it ASAP. Do not be afraid to reach out to me personally. You can always contact me on discord @jos√©#6011. I will be the one with dancing kirby profile pic. Thank you for using my bot, I appreciate you all!

    - Permissions Required to Use: Ability to manage events
    - Parameters: channel (required), date (required) (YYYY/MM/DD), time (required)(HH:MM), am-pm (required), atatchment (optional)
    - This command is used to schedule messages for any desired time and date.

    </h3>

    - Once the command is entered you will be sent a direct message from the bot prompting you to enter the message you desire and you will have 10 mins to do so before the the command times out. Type the message into your direct messages with the bot. The bot will then save your message and send a confirmation message.
    - I suggest drafting your message before using the command because once schedule you cannot edit or delete your message until it is sent.
    - Note: If you are using an @ other than @everyone it will not work when the annoucment is posted. You will have to manually add the @ after the message has been posted.
