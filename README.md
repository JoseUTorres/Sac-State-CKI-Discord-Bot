The Sac State CKI Discord bot is a bot for Circle K International focused discord servers. With discord being used more by clubs there has become a need for CKI specific commands that other bots do not satisfy so this will be the place to provide those features. There was a previous version that was using Python but that version was more of a proof of concept. Now that I know more of what goes into a great bot, I have created a new version written in JS that hopefully works better and is easier to implement/update. I will do my best to get features made quickly but I do have work along with my social life so please be patient with me. Also if there any bugs or errors let me know and I will investigate it ASAP.

If anything this is just a way for me to provide my skills to help the club. I hope you find the bot useful and please recommend any features that would help out! Do not be afraid to reach out to me personally. You can always contact me on discord @jos√©#6011. I will be the one with dancing kirby profile pic. Thank you for using my bot, I appreciate you all!
